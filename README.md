# GROCERY APP - REACT, REDUX

This app, written with the React JavaScript framework and Redux, retrieves data from an existing grocery database and displays it in a user-friendly way. It uses modern ES6 features and is divided into small components that are easy to test and maintain. Some of the main components include service-context, error-boundary, error-indicator, spinner, and high-order components.

For Redux, the app uses provider, connect, mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps, reducer, actions, and thunkMiddleware.

The main functionalities are:
- Add items to cart
- Display list of items in cart with the ability to add, subtract, or delete items
- Show final purchase and price
